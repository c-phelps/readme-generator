## Description
 This is a program that takes input and generates a README.md file for the user. The program is run in Node and uses the inquirer 8.2.4 and node-fetch 2.7.0 npm packages. When the code executese there is a fetch request made to GitHub APIs to recieve a list of the most common licenses. When the user selects a license, there is a fetch request to retrieve specific information related to that license. A markdown file is created based off of each prompt that the user responds to and a badge is created dynamically depending on the license selected. Each license image is created individually using shields.io bages and has a link to the license's URL. The table of contents links will redirect the user to the different sections of the README file.
